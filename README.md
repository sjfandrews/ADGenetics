# Genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease

Snakemake workflow for investigating the Genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease across multiple genome-wide association studies

## Workflow

`munge.R`: Standarize and harmonize AD GWAS datasets

`scripts/combine.R`: combine AD gwas datasets and annotations

`plots.R`: AD Genetic architecture plots

`descriptives.R`: Descriptive statistics for AD GWAS

`power_plots.R`: Power curves for AD gwas

`lbd_gwas.R` & `pd_gwas.R`: munge, combine, and plot LBD and PD genetic architecture.
